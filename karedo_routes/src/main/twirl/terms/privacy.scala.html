  <h4>Privacy Policy</h4>
  <p>Effective on 11th November&nbsp;2016</p>
  <p>Karedo website and mobile application&nbsp;(collectively, the &ldquo;Web Estate&rdquo;) is owned and operated by Karedo&nbsp;Limited (&ldquo;Karedo&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo;, or &ldquo;we&rdquo;), and is intended to empower its users with respect to their personal information. Karedo is a private limited company incorporated in England and Wales.</p>
  <p>Your use of the Web Estate and related applications necessarily involves the collection and processing of personal information relating to you. Users of the Web Estate own personal information relating to them and when a user closes their account on the Web Estate, their personal information will be deleted. This Privacy Policy, along with our Terms of Use <a href="/terms">Terms &amp; Conditions</a>, explains how Karedo collects, uses, and processes the personal and other information that you make available to us on the Web Estate, related mobile applications, and other services (collectively, the &ldquo;Services&rdquo;). It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use and sharing of your personal information.</p>
  <p>You are in control of your personal information on our Services, and we will not share your personal information with a third party unless you tell us to do so or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. Your personal information will only be exchanged within the Karedo marketplace. Third-party brands, retailers, and consumer businesses that offer credits to you through the Web Estate will not get access to your personal information unless you agree, ensuring that you retain control over its use.</p>
  <h4>CHANGES TO THE POLICY</h4>
  <p>Any changes we may make to our Privacy Policy in the future will be posted on this page and, where appropriate, notified to you by e-mail.&nbsp;We encourage you to check to see if there have been any updates or changes to our Privacy Policy. Your continued use of our Services constitutes your consent to any changes made to the Privacy Policy and/or our Terms &amp; Conditions.</p>
  <h4>OUR SERVICES</h4>
  <p>The Web Estate is committed to empowering the consumer to take control of when, how, and by whom their personal information is used. The Services aim to ensure that, within the Web Estate environment, you only receive marketing and advertising content that you want to see, on terms that you deem acceptable. It also allows you to temporarily exchange your information with third parties, in exchange for payments and rewards that can later be used to purchase digital products, subscriptions and services.</p>
  <p>Through the Web Estate, and associated applications, you can contribute a wide variety of information relating to yourself, ranging from personal information, financial information, demographic information, electronic communications, and data from your accounts with social networking sites (collectively, &ldquo;your data&rdquo; or &ldquo;user data&rdquo;). We collect some of this information directly from you when you register or subsequently interact with the Web Estate or application. You may also contribute information residing on third-party platforms, such as social media platforms and/or financial institutions (each, a &ldquo;Third-Party Platform&rdquo;), for the purposes of identification and supplying our Services in a more targeted way.</p>
  <p>For purposes of this Privacy Policy, &ldquo;personal information&rdquo; refers to any information that identifies you or could be used to identify you in and of itself or when combined with other information in our possession or control. It does not include information that has been de-identified or anonymized, for instance data that has been aggregated with other data, such that it is not possible for us to personally identify you.</p>
  <p>We may use your data to target and send you updates from a variety of third parties (such as a coupon, special deals or digital content sent to a subset of users with certain characteristics). In addition, Karedo may share aggregated and/or de-identified data with third parties. Aggregated data is information that the Web Estate generates from individualized information but subsequently maintains and uses in a form that combines together information about numerous individuals so that no individual can be identified. Examples include the number of users who live in a certain geographic area or the categories of purchases most frequently made by users with specific demographic combinations. De-identified information is information from which Karedo has removed any data that personally identifies you. We may disclose aggregated or de-identified data derived from personal information to third parties. We do this to help improve the quality of our services and will always do so in the best interests of our users. By registering for or using our Services, you consent to the collection, use, and sharing of such aggregated and/or de-identified information as Karedo deems appropriate.</p>
