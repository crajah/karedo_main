# Salat

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/salat/salat.svg?branch=1.10.x-branch)](https://travis-ci.org/salat/salat)

Salat is a simple serialization library for case classes.

Salat currently supports bidirectional serialization for:

- MongoDB's `DBObject` (using [casbah][casbah])
- JSON (using [JSON4S][JSON4S])
- maps

# Goals

Simplicity.  Flexibility.  Consistency.

Your model there and back again should just work.

# Get Salat

Salat publishes snapshots and releases to OSS Sontatype.

## Stable Release

Available for Scala 2.10 and 2.11. Based on Casbah 2.8.2, with support for Mongo 3.x

    "com.github.salat" %% "salat" % "1.10.0"

## Snapshot

**Version 1.10.x and Later**

`import salat._`

**Version 1.9.x and Earlier**

`import com.novus.salat._`

### Repositories

Salat has been hosted exclusively by Sonatype since version 0.0.8. Please remove all references to `repo.novus.com` from your build files.

If you are not using sbt 0.11.2+, explicitly add OSS Sonatype to your resolvers:

    resolvers += "Sonatype OSS Snapshots" at "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots"

### Scala 2.10.4

Based on Casbah 2.7.1.

    "com.novus" %% "salat" % "1.9.10"

### Scala 2.9.3

Based on Casbah 2.7.0.

    "com.novus" %% "salat" % "1.9.7"

### Scala 2.9.2

Based on Casbah 2.6.4.

    "com.novus" %% "salat" % "1.9.5"

# Documentation

See the [wiki][wiki] and the [mailing list][group].

# What does Salat support?

See [Supported Types][types].

# What doesn't Salat support?

We don't have the resources to support everything.  Here are some things Salat doesn't do:

- Java compatibility
- non-case classes
- type aliases
- nested inner classes
- varags
- arrays
- multiple constructors
- tuples
- `Option` containing a collection (see [collection support][collections] for workarounds)
- relationship management like a traditional ORM

# How does Salat work?

Salat uses the `Product` trait implemented by case classes with the hi-fi type information found in pickled Scala signatures.

Details are thin on the ground, but here's where we got started:

- the source code for `scala.tools.scalap.scalax.rules.scalasig.ScalaSigParser`
- SID # 10 (draft) - [Storage of pickled Scala signatures in class files][sid10]
