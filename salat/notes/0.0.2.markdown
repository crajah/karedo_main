Second preview release. Focusing on low-hanging performance
improvements and basic feature completeness. This state of code is an
important milestone in proving current approach as superior to that of
casbah-mapper, in terms of performance and overall safety.

In addition to code work, the project's [wiki on GitHub][wiki] is now
populated with basic [docs on getting started][quick-start], overall
[design considerations][design], and [components of
Salat][components].

Notable changes include:

- [Re-wrote][transformer-commit] transformer chain creation code. Made
  better use of memoized type information, dramatically improved
  object inflation performance.

- Added [@Ignore and @Key annotations][annotations-commit]. `@Ignore`,
  when stuck on a field, excludes it from Salat's consideration. The
  field won't be included in generated `DBObject`-s. When encountered
  in `DBObject`-s during object inflation, the data will be dropped on
  the floor. In any case, whether the key is present or not in a
  `DBObject`, a default value is required. Best uesd with `Option[_]`
  fields, where default value can be `None`. `@Key` takes one
  argument, a string, and will use that value as the field's key in
  each generated `DBObject`. Data extraction from `DBObject`-s will
  also happen using this key.

- Forklifted almost verbatim [casbah-mapper's timing
  spec][timing-spec-commit], with the goal of comparing performance
  characteristics. Preliminary results show that Salat's **deflation
  code is 2x as fast** than casbah-mapper's corresponding
  functionality. **Inflation is 15x faster than casbah-mapper**.
