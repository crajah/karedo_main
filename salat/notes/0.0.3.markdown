This release [improves support for use of traits][traits-commit] as
value types and with polymorphic collections, e.g. `Seq`-s and `Map`-s
parameterized with a value type that is serializable by Salat. To
enable use of such traits, there is a a new marker annotation,
`@Salat`. It's supposed to be used on any trait that will be used to
parameterize embedded collections. For more information, please
consult the appropriate [wiki section][traits-wiki].

Salat now also [supports Scala enums][enums-commit] anywhere a value
type can be used. The wiki has been updated with an [enum usage
example][enums-wiki].

Lastly, there is now a [mailing list][mailing-list] where discussion
of Salat-related matters shall commence.
