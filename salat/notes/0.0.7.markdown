- reorganization of Salat project into modules
  - base dependency is now salat-core 0.0.7
- SalatDAO provides simple, extensible turnkey DAO pattern
  - insert, save and remove methods accept case classes
  - find returns an Iterable Mongo cursor typed to your case class - skip, limit, sort and get your objects no fuss no muss
  - query and get back a list of typed ids
  - projections return an Iterable Mongo cursor typed to a case class or a primitive
  - child collection support - find, update, remove, find ids and get back typed projections on children using a typed parent id or typed list of parent ids
- new, more detailed documentation on our [wiki][wiki]
- better error handling, including detailed explanations when graters and constructors misfire
- More flexible @Key behavior to override field name when serializing objects
  - register global overrides at the context level
  - use @Key in a trait or an abstract superclass
- Create a custom context to get more flexible type hinting
  - chose a type hinting strategy: always (default), only when necessary, or never (not recommended)
  - customize the type hint at the context level - replace "_typeHint" with whatever you like
- Use @Persist to persist case class fields that are not declared in the constructor
  - works with var, val and lazy val defined inside case class
  - also works with fields defined in traits or abstract superclasses
