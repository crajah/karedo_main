Bug fixes in Salat 1.9.5 include:

- Safe serialization of doubles: NaN and infinite will be represented as null
- Fix bug deserializing an option containing a case object when the case object also has a context override mapping it to a string
- Fix bug where case object does not correctly deserialize from JSON (#116)
- Casbah dependency updated to 2.6.4

Thanks to @Al-Tsvetkov for #116.
