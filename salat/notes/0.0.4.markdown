I'm pleased to announce the release of version 0.0.4 of Salat, under
the auspices of my startup, [Novus Partners, Inc][novus]. I'm
convinced that this new corporate backing will instill new confidence
in Salat's underpinnings.

Novus' complex and unique data model will expose the code to use cases
not always seen in contrived unit tests. Our challenging performance
requirements and volume of data will also undoubtedly uncover
bottlenecks within Salat. The benefits, as usual, are to be reaped by
the entire community.

As before, the library remains Free/Open Source software, made
available under the Apache 2 license.

Please note that the repository location on GitHub and package names
have all been updated to reflect this move.

- Package rename: `com.bumnetworks.salat` -> `com.novus.salat`
